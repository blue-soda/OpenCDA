Welcome to OpenCDA's documentation!
===================================
OpenCDA is a generalized framework for fast developing and testing
cooperative driving automation applications(e.g., cooperative
perception, platooning) as well as autonomous vehicle components(e.g.,
perception, localization, planning, control) under Co-simulation(CARLA-SUMO).

OpenCDA is a work in progress, and many features are still in the future
roadmap. We welcome your contribution and please visit our Github repo
for latest release.
