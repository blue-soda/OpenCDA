Welcome to OpenCDA
=====

OpenCDA is a generalized framework for fast developing and testing <strong>cooperative driving automation 
applications</strong>(e.g., cooperative perception, platooning) as well as <strong>autonomous vehicle components</strong>(e.g., 
perception, localization, planning, control) on <strong>multi-resolution simulators</strong>(e.g., CARLA, SUMO, NS3).

OpenCDA is a work in progress, and many features are still in the future roadma.
 We welcome your contribution and please visit out Github repo for latest release.
