# SGCP Profiled GFLOPs Summary

This file summarizes detector-side compute from offline trace CSVs. GFLOPs are calibrated from one real OpenCOOD forward when a calibration JSON is provided; otherwise the table still reports forward-equivalent compute and input-size diagnostics.

## Calibration

- fusion_method: `early`
- scenario/timestamp: `2026_07_29_02_32_08/000060`
- CAVs in calibration forward: `1`
- input points: `13948`
- profiled detector GFLOPs/forward: `89.437098`
- FLOP policy: Conv2d/Conv3d/ConvTranspose2d/Linear/BatchNorm/ReLU hooks, sparse-3D active-output proxy, and PillarVFE/MeanVFE elementwise estimate; multiply-add=2 FLOPs; voxelization/hash/scatter memory/index ops excluded

## Notes

- `detector_calls_per_frame` is the number of OpenCOOD detector forwards represented by the trace in one 100 ms perception cycle.
- Pure late/global box baselines can have high AP because many CAVs run local detection; SGCP reduces this by evaluating only cluster heads while still ingesting selected member point clouds.
- `mean_input_points_per_frame` is trace-derived and therefore captures fused point-cloud size, not just the number of receivers.
- `input_adjusted_detector_gflops_per_frame`, when present, uses singleton and dense/full calibrations to model point-dependent VFE point-feature FLOPs on top of fixed BEV Conv/Deconv FLOPs.
- `input_adjusted_point_feature_gflops_per_frame` is the point-cloud-to-feature floating-point subtotal. It includes PillarVFE elementwise feature construction, PFN Linear, BatchNorm and simple activation FLOPs when visible to hooks; it excludes voxelization/hash/scatter memory/index operations.
